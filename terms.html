          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            A Moonbirds NFT is a non-fungible Ethereum-based token that uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
            (“Smart Contracts”). The Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on
            the blockchain. This means that all Moonbirds NFTs are outside of the control of any one party, including
            PROOF, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. PROOF neither owns nor controls MetaMask,
            WalletConnect, the Ethereum network, your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service
            (including third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of
            enabling you to use the Services or to purchase, list, auction, or sell Moonbirds NFTs (“Transaction”), and
            that, except with respect to transferring control of a Moonbirds NFT to the initial purchaser through the
            Services (“Initial Purchaser”), PROOF has no responsibility with respect to any Transaction. PROOF will not
            be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will PROOF be liable for any damage that you
            may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. You understand
            that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction. Aside
            from transferring control of the Moonbirds NFT to the Initial Purchaser, PROOF has no control over the
            transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the Moonbirds NFT.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-sans my-5">Changes to services</h2>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            PROOF reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part
            thereof) with or without notice. You agree that PROOF will not be liable to you or to any third party for
            any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, including in relation to any Moonbirds NFT.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-sans my-5">PROOF Perks</h2>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            A Collector (as defined below) of a Moonbirds NFT may receive special perks, experience, or opportunities as
            determined by PROOF in its sole discretion (“Perks”) after the Moonbirds NFTs are first made available for
            sale (i.e., dropped) by PROOF. PROOF does not make any representation or guarantee that any Collector will
            receive any Perks or achieve any particular outcome as a result of owning any Moonbirds NFT. PROOF reserves
            the right, at its sole discretion, to restrict, limit, or deny any Perks to any Collector, including to
            limit the period of time when a Perk is available, for any reason, at any time. Perks are not intended to be
            an endorsement of any project, creator, NFT, individual or any other thing, and PROOF makes no
            recommendation and provides no investment advice in connection with any Perks or otherwise as a result of
            holding or owning the Moonbirds NFT.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-sans my-5">Connecting your wallet</h2>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            In order to access and use the Services, including engaging in a Transaction on the Services, you must
            connect your account to your digital wallet supported on MetaMask, WalletConnect or other wallet extensions
            or gateways as allowed on the Services. Such digital wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in
            transactions using the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. When you link your cryptocurrency wallet, you
            understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and your
            control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys,
            non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible through your wallet. Any
            unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of
            Moonbirds NFTs and/or funds held in your wallet and any associated wallets, including any linked financial
            information such as bank account(s) or credit card(s). PROOF is not responsible for managing and maintaining
            the security of your cryptocurrency wallet. PROOF has no responsibility or liability to you for any
            unauthorized access to or use of your cryptocurrency wallet or if you are unable to locate your credentials.
            If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your cryptocurrency wallet that seems to be related
            to the Services, please notify us immediately.

          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            When each Moonbirds NFT is sold for the first time, the agreement for sale is between PROOF and the Initial
            Purchaser. If the Initial Purchaser decides to sell a Moonbirds NFT (“Secondary Sale”), then PROOF is not a
            party to any agreement between the applicable buyer, seller, or facilitator of the Secondary Sale.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            If you or any owner of a Moonbirds NFT (“Collector”) sells or transfers a Moonbirds NFT to another
            collector, (a) then you, as Collector, represent and warrant that you will notify the subsequent collector
            of these Terms and require the subsequent collector to comply with these Terms, (b) the Collector License
            (as defined below) as set forth herein will automatically transfer to such subsequent collector, and such
            other collector will be deemed the “Collector” (for purposes of such Moonbirds NFT and the Collector License
            to the underlying Art (as defined below)) and will be subject to these Terms, and (c) you, as the seller or
            transferor of such Moonbirds NFT, will cease to have any further rights to such Moonbirds NFT or underlying
            Art.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            By placing an order on the Site or through the Services (including by bidding in an auction), you agree that
            you are submitting a binding offer to purchase a Moonbirds NFT, you agree to pay all applicable fees
            associated with the Transaction, and you authorize PROOF to automatically charge and collect such fees from
            your payment instrument or wallet. If you are an Initial Purchaser, then all amounts due are to be paid to
            PROOF. If you are not the Initial Purchaser of a Moonbirds NFT, then amounts may be paid to the seller of
            such Moonbirds NFT.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            You acknowledge and agree that PROOF receives 5.0% of every Secondary Sale of a Moonbirds NFT (“Royalty”).
            PROOF has the right to collect Royalties for PROOF sales in perpetuity. As such, if you sell a Moonbirds NFT
            on a third-party marketplace, you agree to include a statement substantially similar to the following in the
            description of the NFT: “5.0% Royalty Applies. By purchasing a Moonbirds NFT, you agree to the Terms of Use
            located at https://moonbirds.xyz/terms”

          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            You are responsible for any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or
            hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority, associated with your use of the Services, Perks
            or Moonbirds NFTs (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your

          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, PROOF grants you a worldwide,
            royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the digital art represented by your Moonbirds NFT (“Art”),
            along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your
            own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your
            Moonbirds NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to
            display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii)
            as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of
            your Moonbirds NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT
            owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display
            the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Moonbirds NFT leaves the
            website/application.
          </p>
          <p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">
            Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, PROOF grants you a worldwide license
            to use, copy, and display the Art represented by your Moonbirds NFT for the purpose of creating derivative
            works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the Art to
            produce and sell merchandise products (e.g., T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of
            clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace
            that permits the use and sale of Moonbirds NFT generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
            verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only
            the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that
            permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Moonbirds NFT generally, provided that the third
            party website or application cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art
            for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art
            is no longer visible once the owner of the Moonbirds NFT leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning
            revenue from any of the foregoing.

            construed as, professional advice or a recommendation to purchase, sell, trade, or otherwise transact in any

            purchase, sale, trade, or other transaction with respect to any digital asset.

            The digital assets about which information is provided on the Site and any information provided in

            laws or relevant applicable laws. As a result it is unlikely that fulsome disclosures from the issuer or
            sponsor, or any executive officer associated with the digital asset or related protocol have been provided,

            There are risks associated with purchasing and holding digital assets. Loss of the full amount of the

            entirely due to forking, flaws in the code, hacking or other malicious attacks.
